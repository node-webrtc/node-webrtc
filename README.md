[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/wrtc.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wrtc) [![macOS/Linux Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/js-platform/node-webrtc.svg?branch=develop)](http://travis-ci.org/js-platform/node-webrtc) [![Windows Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/iulc84we28o1i7b9?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/markandrus/node-webrtc-7bnua)

node-webrtc provides Node.js bindings to [WebRTC M70](https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/webrtc/+/branch-heads/70). You can write Node.js applications that use RTCDataChannels with it. **Some MediaStream APIs are supported now!.**

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

This library will attempt to download pre-compiled binaries for your particular
platform using [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp); however,
if binaries are unavailable, it will fallback to building from source using
[node-cmake](https://github.com/cjntaylor/node-cmake). When building from
source, in addition to the prerequisites required by node-cmake, you will need

* Git
* CMake 3.12 or newer
* GCC 5.4 or newer (Linux)
* Xcode 9 or newer (macOS)
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (Windows)
* Any [additional prerequisites listed by WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/native-code/development/prerequisite-sw)

## Install

The easiest way to install is via npm:

```
npm install wrtc
```

If you want to work from source, run

```
git clone https://github.com/js-platform/node-webrtc.git
cd node-webrtc
npm install
```

Depending on what you checkout, `npm install` will either download a
pre-compiled binary or attempt to build from source. Set `SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true` to
always build from source. See below for more information on building from
source.

## Build

If you would like to build node-webrtc from source, run

```
./node_modules/.bin/ncmake rebuild
```

You can pass either `--debug` or `--release` to build a debug or release build
of node-webrtc (and the underlying WebRTC library). Refer to
[node-cmake](https://github.com/cjntaylor/node-cmake) for additional
command-line options to `ncmake`.

### Other Notes

#### Linux

On Linux, we statically link libc++ and libc++abi. Also, although we compile
WebRTC sources with Clang (downloaded as part of WebRTC's build process), we
compile node-webrtc sources with GCC 5.4 or newer.

#### macOS

On macOS, we compile WebRTC sources with the version of Clang downloaded as part
of WebRTC's build process, but we compile node-webrtc sources using the system
Clang.

#### Windows

On Windows, we do not compile WebRTC sources with Clang. This is disabled by
passing `is_clang=false` to `gn gen`.

# Tests

## Unit & Integration Tests

Once everything is built, run

```
npm test
```

## Web Platform Tests

[w3c/web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) defines a suite of WebRTC tests. node-webrtc borrows a technique from [jsdom/jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) to run these tests in Node.js. Run the tests with

```
npm run wpt:test
```

## MediaStream Loopback Example

This example demonstrates relaying MediaStreamTracks through node-webrtc. Run
the example with

```
node examples/loopback.server.js
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080/loopback.client.html](http://localhost:8080/loopback.client.html).
You should be prompted for your microphone and webcam. Once granted, the browser
negotiates an RTCPeerConnection with the server, and the server relays the
browser's MediaStreamTracks. Finally, these are displayed in a &lt;video&gt;
element in the browser.
